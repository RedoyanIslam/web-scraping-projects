# Periodic Table Web Scraping Project

This repository contains a Python script and extracted data for scraping the periodic table from [www.periodni.com](https://www.periodni.com/periodic_table_of_the_elements.html). The project demonstrates how to extract structured chemical element data from a website, save it as an Excel file, and visualize it with a plot.

## Contents

- `periodic_table_scrap.py`: Python script that scrapes periodic table data and exports it to Excel.
- `periodic_table.xlsx`: Extracted periodic table data in Excel format (see citation below).
- `Plot.png`: Visualization of atomic mass vs. atomic number.

## Project Purpose

This project was created for educational purposes to practice and demonstrate web scraping skills using Python, BeautifulSoup, and data processing libraries. It is intended as a learning resource for those interested in web automation, data extraction, and scientific visualization.

## How It Works

1. The script downloads the periodic table page from www.periodni.com.
2. It parses the HTML to extract relevant chemical element data.
3. The data is saved into an Excel spreadsheet for easy access and analysis.
4. A plot is generated to visualize the relationship between atomic mass and atomic number.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- (Optional) `openpyxl` for Excel export
- `matplotlib` for plotting

## Visualization

Below is the plot generated by the script, showing the relationship between atomic mass and atomic number:
